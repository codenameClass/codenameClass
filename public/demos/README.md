# Portfolio
Hello, my name is Jens and I'm a Full Stack Engineer with a specialty in .NET. This is my portfolio where I showcase my public projects that are available on Github.

## Qualification Assignment Solution
A full-stack solution that combines the [Qualification Assignment API](https://github.com/codenameClass/QualificationAssignment) and the [Qualification Assignment React](https://github.com/codenameClass/qualification-assignment-react) front-end. The solution is built using .NET and React. The API layer provides a Rest API that the front-end uses to access the data. The front-end allows users to interact with the API, providing a user-friendly interface for data input and output. The API uses the FluentValidation package to ensure that incoming data is well-formed and meets the necessary requirements, providing a secure and reliable experience. Overall, the Qualification Assignment Solution is a robust, scalable, and user-friendly solution that showcases the basic concepts of a layered architecture and front-end in a real-world application.
